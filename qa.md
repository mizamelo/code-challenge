We don't want our customers to have problems and bugs while using our platform, Zé Delivery. Specially in this super important moment, which is when he chooses a cold beer to enjoy it right away.

Well, having that in mind, we are implementing a few things to minimize this risk:
*To develop the code challange, please use our platform: https://ze.delivery


### 1. Define the KBFs:

Define the 3 main KBFs important to the business.
* KBF = Key Business Flow, the most important flows to the business to keep the platform working properly


### 2. Create test plans:

Develop a test plan for each of these 3 KBFs and explain the kind of test that you would do, the acceptance criterias and the results found

### 3. Automated test

For each scenario developed, check if it's possible to be automated.
If possible, develop this test in the framework/language that you feel more confortable


### 4. Automated test applications

Finally, describe how would you include all these tests in your daily work routine: Tool used to develop and run tests, integrations and timming considering the devs team.

Use your knolegde and new ideias, in this item 4 your criativity and experience level will be evaluated.
